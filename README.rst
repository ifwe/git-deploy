**Sartoris**

The project is named after a novel authored by William Faulkner entitled Sartoris, first published in 1929.
It portrays the decay of the Mississippi aristocracy following the social upheaval of the American Civil War.

This name was chosen because Ryan Faulkner is working on the project and we thought it would be funny.
